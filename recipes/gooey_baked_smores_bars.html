        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips (about one 11.5-ounce bag)</li>
            <li>1 (7-ounce jar) marshmallow creme</li>
            <li>1 cup mini marshmallows</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 x 13 pan with foil (overhanging the sides) and spray with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, beat together sugar, butter, vanilla and egg for about 2 minutes. Mix in graham cracker crumbs, flour and salt until thoroughly combined. Reserve 1 cup of this mixture. Press the remaining mixture into the bottom of the pan for the crust.</li>
                <li>Evenly layer chocolate chips on top of crust. Drop spoonfuls of marshmallow creme over the chocolate chips. Using the back of a spoon warmed with hot water gently spread creme evenly over the chips, stopping to rinse spoon and warm with water as needed. Sprinkle the marshmallows and reserved graham mixture over the top.</li>
                <li>Bake for 18-22 minutes or until marshmallows start to lightly brown. Cool thoroughly before lifting foil from pan and cutting into squares.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Generously spray your lined pan with cooking spray to prevent bars from sticking. Once cool, lift the foil out of the pan and place on a cutting board to easily slice the bars.</li>
                <li>Not a milk chocolate chip fan? Use dark chocolate instead. Or chop up chocolate bars. The options to customize this recipe are endless.</li>
                <li>Use a food processor to quickly make graham cracker crumbs from graham crackers or buy a box of crumbs from the store. You'll find them in the baking aisle.</li>
                <li>The marshmallow creme is STICKY and can be tough to spread. Run your spoon or spreader under hot water and dry before attempting to spread the creme. Repeat as often as needed.</li>
                <li>Store these bars in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
            </ul>
